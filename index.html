<article><b><h2><center><font color="purple">Code Geass</b></h2></center>
    <center><img src="images/Code Geass.jpg" alt="Image Unavailable" height="350" width="240"></center>
<p>Code Geass is an anime created by Sunrise Studio back in 2006.  It has two seasons of 25 episodes each
     and follows the adventures of an anti-hero by the name of Lelouch Lamperouge, who attends class during
      the day and mascarades as the Black Knights liberation group leader Zero.  He posseses a 
      super power called geass that gives him absolute control over anyone he uses it on, but it has a few limitations.  
      This anime is not for the faint of heart as it deals with death, murder, mind control, and a lot of morally gray 
      characters.  It will make you question whether the ends justify the means and at what point 
      do you say that's going too far.
